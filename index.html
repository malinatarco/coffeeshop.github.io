                <h3>Coffee</h3>
                <p>Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, 
                    and slightly acidic, coffee has a stimulating effect on humans, primarily due 
                    to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world market for hot drinks.</p>

                <img src="https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/legacy_blog/espresso.jpg" alt="Espresso">
                <p>Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of 
                    nearly boiling water (about 90 °C or 190 °F) is forced under 9-10 bars of pressure
                     through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso can be made with a wide variety of
                      coffee beans and roast degrees. Espresso is the most common way of making coffee
                       in southern Europe, especially in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal.</p>

                <img src="https://nomadbarista.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cappuccino.jpg" alt="Cappuccino">
                <p>A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink and is traditionally prepared with steamed
                     milk foam (microfoam). Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk,
                     using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder. It
                     is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.</p>

                <h3>Coffee Beans</h3>
                <p>The two most economically important varieties of coffee plant are the Arabica and
                     the Robusta; approximately 60% of the coffee produced worldwide is Arabica and
                      ~40% is Robusta.[5] Arabica beans consist of 0.8-1.4% caffeine and Robusta beans
                       consist of 1.7-4.0% caffeine.[6] As coffee is one of the world's most widely
                        consumed beverages, coffee beans are a major cash crop and an important export
                         product, accounting for over 50% of some developing nations' foreign exchange
                          earnings.</p>

                <h3>Coffee Preparation</h3>
                <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into liquid coffee. While
                    the particular steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials,
                    the process includes four basic steps: raw coffee beans must be roasted, the
                    roasted coffee beans must then be ground, and the ground coffee must then be mixed
                    with hot or cold water (depending on the method of brewing) for a specific time
                    (brewed), the liquid coffee extraction must be separated from the used grounds,
                    and finally, if desired, the extracted coffee is combined with other elements
                    of the desired beverage, such as sweeteners, dairy products, dairy alternatives,
                    or toppings (such as shaved chocolate).</p>

                <p>Caffè latte, often shortened to just latte in English, is a coffee drink of Italian
                     origin made with espresso and steamed milk. Variants include the chocolate-flavored
                      mocha or replacing the coffee with another beverage base such as masala chai (spiced
                       Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; alternatives to milk, such as soy
                        milk or almond milk, are also used.</p>
